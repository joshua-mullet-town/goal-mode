## Objective

[Describe what you're trying to achieve and why. Be specific enough that success is obvious.]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1 (must be testable/verifiable)
- [ ] Criterion 2

1. How to verify criterion 1
2. How to verify criterion 2
3. How to verify criterion 3

## Reset Steps

[Optional - how to clean up after a test so you can test again]

1. Step to reset state
2. Step to clean up test data

## Notes

[Claude Code writes observations here as it works - what it tried, what failed, what's next]

## Escape Conditions

- Max iterations: 10
- If stuck with no path forward, set Status to STUCK
- If all success criteria met, set Status to DONE
