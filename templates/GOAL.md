# GOAL: [Short description of the goal]

## Status: PENDING
## Max iterations: 10

---

## Objective

[Describe WHAT needs to be accomplished and HOW to do it. Be specific enough
that an agent can work independently. Include any important constraints,
approaches, or implementation details.]

## Verification

[Define commands to run that prove the goal is complete. Include expected outputs.]

- Command: `[exact command to run]`
- Expected: `[exact expected output]`

## Evidence

[DO NOT EDIT - Agent fills this section during VERIFYING phase.
Only add content here when you have EXTREME CONFIDENCE the goal is complete.
The Evidence section is how your work will be judged.]

## Notes

[Agent logs progress, observations, and errors here throughout the process.]
